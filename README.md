# tile-map

Test out methods for making a single sprite sheet based tilemap that is performant.

## Overview

A tile map implentation using ParticleContainer in Pixi.

Tiles from Brandon Jones. http://blog.tojicode.com/2012/07/sprite-tile-maps-on-gpu.html Who lifted them from Spelunky: http://www.spelunkyworld.com/

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

    lein clean

To create a production build run:

    lein do clean, cljsbuild once min

And open your browser in `resources/public/index.html`. You will not
get live reloading, nor a REPL.
